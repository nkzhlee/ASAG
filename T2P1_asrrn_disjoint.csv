R_W8qdkKit0alV2mt_q3_b,If more than 5% of the screens tested by an engeneer are faulty then there is probabbly an issue with the production. if its outside the predicted statistical margin of error there is no telling by how much.,q3_b,2.0,,2.0,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,1,0
R_3j8NCgfokq2Z97X_q2_a,I would use statistical inference with a large sample size in order to have a better gathering of data to see if Carla was actually correct and had a good ear for music or if she was simply guessing and didn't get them all right.,q2_a,2.0,,2.0,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,1,1
R_2zopTvp2rALhXHA_q3_a,No because determining how much out of the bulk is bad can be determined by simple math calculations.,q3_a,2.0,,2.0,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,1,1
R_2XasEcUnU3o3pPd_q3_b,"If they test them and five percent of the TVs are faulty then they should reject them, especially above five percent. They are inferring the rest will be bad, which is probably true. They should accept them if they work mostly.",q3_b,2.0,,2.0,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,1,0
R_2CjsCZiomZQ4mfj_q2_a,"Yes, you can compare her ability to name notes against other students who have an ear for for music",q2_a,2.0,,2.0,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,1,1
R_1exZMlpLwxi7Rfp_q4_b,"also, mark and dan should be comparing weight, not length.  / by creating tables of the weights of the fish from each brother,  means can be taken from each and the difference can be found. by testing the naul that the means of both brothers are homologus, we can either reject or FTR by finding the difference and from there the p value to determine the level of significance.",q4_b,2.0,,2.0,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,1,0
R_3s7z2L1LPSAentK_q4_a,"Yes, they should use it to find out if there is a possibility that one of them caught bigger fish by chance.",q4_a,2.0,,2.0,1.0,3,2,1,2,0,2,1,1
R_25vHf0jCzvDqusw_q2_a,I think it could be useful because we can compare her results to others and determine if she does a have a good ear for music.,q2_a,1.0,,2.0,2.0,3,2,1,2,0,2,1,1
R_1exZMlpLwxi7Rfp_q2_b,"first, you need a control or some baseline to compare Carla to. For the purpose of this example we will say that if Carla can accurately identify the note 50% of the time then she has a good ear for music.  / Carla follows the experiment guidelines and choosed the correct note 8 times out of 15. we convert her accuracy to a porpotion and compare it to our baseline of 50%. we then calculate the p value and determine if Carla is gifted.",q2_b,1.0,,2.0,2.0,3,2,1,2,0,2,1,1
R_1CkjntzxZOjssV7_q2_b,"If I was to analyze a students accuracy of note identification, I would find the standard deviation of her accuracy and then calculate the confidence interval for her average note identification accuracy, and use this as a guage of her ability.",q2_b,2.0,,0.0,2.0,3,2,1,2,0,2,1,1
R_11ha0WwH6uMEOWR_q2_a,"From sampling Carla's ability to identify the notes correctly, we would be using statistical inference to make judgements on whether or not she has a good ear for music.",q2_a,2.0,,2.0,1.0,3,2,1,2,0,2,1,1
R_3r2GLiuvfSYrxWB_q4_a,"I believe that statistical inference can be used based on the sample of fishes, but this only holds for the location(s) where they caught the fishes. A problem might be that even though the brothers could move freely in the area, they could not be randomly assigned to equally good fishing places, which could be a confounding factor. Statistical inference can be used in general because you want to generalize from a sample of fishes to the population of fishes the brothers catch.",q4_a,2.0,2.0,,,2,1,0,2,0,2,1,1
