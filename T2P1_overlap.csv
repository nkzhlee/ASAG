R_OHDpXXS48HwjgsN_q3_a,No. Because you can determine whether or not 5% of the units are bad without it.,q3_a,2.0,,2.0,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,1,2
R_54rp3Ziy4Qot1xX_q3_a,No you should not use it because you cannot take a sample and generalize it to the whole. Each computer should be tested and a decision should be base upon that.,q3_a,2.0,,2.0,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,1,2
R_4HoW8YibuRh1TVL_q3_a,"No.  The sample size is small enough that the benefit of testing all of the units to accept or reject the order is feasible.  It would depend upon the cost of the screens, and the cost of the testing as well.  You can test the screens until you reach the 8th defect, and that would be the one that determines rejecting the entire order.",q3_a,2.0,2.0,,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,1,2
R_3Ny8iBQloIk5Ha2_q2_a,"I think you could use a statistical inference to help determine whether or not Carla has a ""good ear for music"". There are many ways you could determine this, I think the best way is to have her listen to each note and say which note she thinks it is and figure out the probablilty of her getting the note correct.",q2_a,2.0,,2.0,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,1,2
R_3LbaqxVILA3dyOi_q2_a,"Yes, it could be used in this scenario. After the notes are played Carla could be asked to name which note it is, then the data collected could be used to determine if she has a good ear or not.",q2_a,2.0,,2.0,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,1,2
R_2Pe9I3Rxhndc7pQ_q3_b,they should reject the tbs if 5%or more of the 150tv screens are bad other wise they should keep the order.,q3_b,2.0,,2.0,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,1,2
R_26gpxE1m7xovdaA_q4_b,Use a 2 sample t test to determine whether Mark or Dan is the better fisherman. Null hypothesis should be y1 = y2. The alternative should be y1 does not equal y2. If p is great than .05 than fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that they are equally good. If p is less than .05 than reject the null hypothesis and determine that one is better than the other. The one with the greater y value is then the better fisherman.,q4_b,2.0,,2.0,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,1,2
R_6u0AG0QLZtjNc1v_q2_a,"Yes, you should use statistical inference to determine this information. You would collect the data of whether Carla correctly identified the note or didn't correct identify the note then record the data. After, you would use statistical inference to interpret the data you collected.",q2_a,,1.0,2.0,2.0,3,2,1,2,0,2,1,2
