R_3KZMO16R6JknU0E_q3_b,You would want to test the 150 screens and show that more than 5 % of them would be bad. You would want to find the standard deviation and then the z-score and then find what % would actually be bad. If this is more than 5% then they would be able to reject there order.,q3_b,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,0,2
R_2wBSrzMDz86nZtv_q3_b,"First what we need to do is obtain the number of screens that were considered bad. We then find the null and alternative hypothesis. The null would be H0: p = .005 an the alternative hypothesis would be HA: p >.005. Then we have to check if it passes the assumptions of whether the data was a random sample, whether the data was 10% less than the entire population and the success or failure condition (np > 10; and n(1-p)). We then state whether it will be distributed normally. Find the mean (which is the same as the null) and the standard deviation (sqrt of(( P0 (1-p0)/n)). Find the z statistic which is p-hat - p0 divided by the standard deviation. Find the p value from the z table an subtract than from one. If the value is smaller than alpha than reject the H0 and if it is bigger than alpha do not reject the H0. Create a conclusion see whether the 150 screens are bad.",q3_b,1.0,,0.0,1.0,3,2,1,2,0,1,0,2
