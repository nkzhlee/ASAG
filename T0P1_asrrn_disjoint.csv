R_OjJj1pshs75HNkd_q2_b,I would go through every note twice and see if the students answer is the same throughout. If it is then the student has a good ear for music.,q2_b,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,1
R_8iVkPUHhGaqYupX_q2_b,I would use a random number table assigning each note to a number and throw out any extra numbers. Then go about seeing whether or not they can identify the note.  Then I would have a second piano to repeat with a new set but have the piano be out of tune.,q2_b,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,1
R_4HoW8YibuRh1TVL_q4_a,"If the question is who is a better fisherman, no.  If the question is who caught more fish (number, weight) then yes.",q4_a,0.0,0.0,,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,1
R_4HoW8YibuRh1TVL_q2_a,"Having a ""good ear for music,"" is a term used to describe someone who has good relative pitch and can play or sing a tune.  Having good relative pitch means that you can start at a note and match the intervals going from note to note in a tune, even if the key is changed.  Someone who can identify individual notes played by an instrument is said to have ""perfect pitch.""  That person may or may not actually have a good ear for music, they can simply identify notes.  Having perfect pitch does not necessarily mean that a person has a good ear for music, although it is usually the case.  They are simply two different musical terms.  (says the singer).",q2_a,0.0,0.0,,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,1
R_3suHzxtuLtxpssL_q2_b,"Play a tone a couple of times and instruct them to remember that. Shortly after, ask them to point the tone out in a series of tones or specific songs.",q2_b,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,0
R_3rSsapLCzLuUW08_q4_a,"No, I would not use statistical inference to determine whether Mark or Dan is a better Walleye fisherman. You would have the mean and standard deviation of the fish caught as well as how many (n). But a confidence interval for this question makes no sense.",q4_a,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,0
R_31KRIyDEf8o9k27_q3_b,If there are many bad screens its a no brainer to reject the order.,q3_b,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,0

R_2zoLG9aI1FBHT1K_q2_a,"No, because she has a 1/7 chance to get it right every time so the statistics would be the same for every individual.",q2_a,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,0
R_2XasEcUnU3o3pPd_q2_b,"I think in order to make sure she doesn't just know pitches on the piano, I would test her on multiple instruments. We would test a brass instrument, woodwind, piano and a violin. Or if that isn't effective, then I would randomize the notes each time on the piano at different intervals.",q2_b,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,1
R_2vizuByAiaPctAn_q2_b,I would decide by how close the student was to the note. A certain amount of points for getting close to it and full amount of points for getting the note.,q2_b,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,1
R_2Pe9I3Rxhndc7pQ_q4_b,you would see on average who caught more fish and then see if you accept or reject the value thus deciding whether or not u reject or accept the hypothesis,q4_b,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,1
R_23Ww6BQ8ySAi4Ma_q3_b,I think they should check each of the screens and see if any of them don't work and if some of them don't work they should take them back and keep the ones that do at a discounted rate.,q3_b,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,0
R_23Ww6BQ8ySAi4Ma_q2_b,I personally would have the student blindfolded and play each key on the piano then I would put the piano out of tune and see if they notice if anything sounded funny. I perform these test with other instruments like the guitar and violin.,q2_b,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,0
R_22YwZfKEz4dkvsz_q2_a,"it is very difficult to measure someones ""ear for music"" in statistical terms. It is possible that her results could vary every time they tested.",q2_a,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,1
R_22liJUNlTskZw31_q4_a,You can use simple math to figure this out.,q4_a,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,1
R_21iwh2KSgFnqoWt_q2_b,"Other ways that I think would work better to see if she had a good ear for music if the teacher could play a few notes and then have the student to around and walk back to the piano and play what she just played. If you can memorize the notes in order and then perform them, then I feel like you have  a great ear for music.",q2_b,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,0
R_1HeIWMAVfNldGx0_q2_a,The only way we could determine if this student has a good ear for music is to survey her and ask if she has previously taken any piano lessons or classes and has any knowledge of the notes before testing her.,q2_a,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,1
R_1F8K5YVgEN1RRaK_q3_a,"I would use Statistical Inference, because i would have to multiply 5% by 150 find out which ones are bad. Subtract the end result to find the amount that are good.",q3_a,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,1

R_UawbgkpZaqjua8F_q3_b,If the majority of the display screens are of good quality then you go ahead with the order because you can still use most of them.,q3_b,1.0,,0.0,0.0,3,2,1,2,0,0,1,0
R_8iVkPUHhGaqYupX_q3_b,What you would do is after a certain amount of data points then see if they fall to close to the 5% that they are comfortable with or fall farther away to make the choice easier.,q3_b,0.0,,0.0,1.0,3,2,1,2,0,0,1,0
R_6RktEQMK2li2kVP_q2_a,It should not be used because a percentage of how many notes she got correct is all that is needed.,q2_a,1.0,,0.0,0.0,3,2,1,2,0,0,1,0
R_6qZ3b2sexiJuOvn_q3_b,"I think it would be rather easy in deciding whether to accept or reject the order of display screens. About 5% out of 150 isn't very many, so rejecting the order in that situation may not be the best decision. They may not lose too much money in that situation. But if there are too many screens that are bad, I think it would be better for the company to reject the order. Too many screens being damaged could cause them to lose too much money, than if they reject it for a refund. Also, if too many screens are damaged and they are unsatisfied with their service, they could change to a better company.",q3_b,0.0,,0.0,1.0,3,2,1,2,0,0,1,0
R_3t3zXXa9AqP3uLz_q2_b,You would determing whether the student has a good ear for music using this method of note identification by testing this method multiple times on the same student to make sure that the method is accurate and you have enough data to compare to.,q2_b,1.0,,0.0,0.0,3,2,1,2,0,0,1,0
R_3s7z2L1LPSAentK_q2_b,"You would have to use the z score somehow to figure out the alpha value and if the alpha value is greater than the p value, you fail to reject the null hypothesis meaning that it was not by chance.

R_3Ny8iBQloIk5Ha2_q4_b,All you need to do is write down the length of each fish they caught and also what kind of bait they used to catch that fish. When you write down all the information then you can determine who caught the bigger fish. Because when you write down which bait they used then you can see which bait works best for catching Walleye.,q4_b,0.0,,0.0,1.0,3,2,1,2,0,0,1,0
R_3dYurRTniIE1iIx_q4_b,You would add the amount of fish and divide it by the total length of the fish altogether.  Do this for each brother and the one with the better ratio on average is the better fisherman.,q4_b,1.0,,0.0,0.0,3,2,1,2,0,0,1,1
R_2XasEcUnU3o3pPd_q4_a,"No, because even though they are inferring who catches larger fish on their average from this trip, they should do it multiple times to check if it's accurate. Fishing is based on a lot of luck.",q4_a,1.0,,0.0,0.0,3,2,1,2,0,0,1,0

R_2f6ST76DzsSNu3m_q4_a,Statistical inference should not be used here. The average length of the fish they catch doesn't determine who a better fisherman is.

R_2Bsdca66eX1sB7s_q2_b,"I would decide whether a student has a good ear for music by running a a simple random survey.  This would be done by the same test that is going on, seeing which notes are missed and which are correct, and comparing this to see if it is easier to get a note correct if the prior one was correct or wrong.  For example if the first note was B and the next C, since C is chronologically after B it may be easier to recognize the note for C.",q2_b,0.0,,0.0,1.0,3,2,1,2,0,0,1,1
R_28LE4NyOf0wpTW8_q4_b,"Instead of recording the length of fish, they should record the number of fish caught each day. Then, they should find the average number of fish for each of their trip. To find the average, you could use the STAT function, enter the first brothers number of fish each day into the L1. Then you could press STAT again and scroll over to CALC and select 1-VARS STATS. X bar is the mean and record the first brothers mean, then clear L1 and repeat these steps, recording X bar for the second brother. Then compare the numbers",q4_b,1.0,,0.0,0.0,3,2,1,2,0,0,1,1
R_26gpxE1m7xovdaA_q3_a,Statistical inference should be used because you cannot inspect each TV in the bulk order to determine if 5% of the display screens are bad. This is not efficient.,q3_a,0.0,,0.0,1.0,3,2,1,2,0,0,1,0
R_1JOXCiX9jdkkoid_q2_b,"I would start with a table and determine how you are going to administer notes being heard. Single handed, at a random point in a song, what type of song, easy/ hard, etc. When the note hearing style is heart I would have them write which note they thought they heard.
