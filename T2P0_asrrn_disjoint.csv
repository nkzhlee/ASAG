R_xl2qsdRZ4GDIRgZ_q3_b,"In order to decide whether the electronics company should accept or reject the order of display screens using the data gathered by the trained engineer, I would list all the data in a table inside Statcrunch. I would then use the Normal calculator to see if the number of screens that is bad is greater than a proportion of 0.05 of these 150 display screens. If the result of the Normal calculator shows that, indeed, the number of screens that is bad is greater than a proportion of 0.05 of these 150 display screens, we would know to reject the order. If not, however, we would be forced to accept the order instead.",q3_b,,2.0,2.0,,2,1,0,2,0,2,0,0
