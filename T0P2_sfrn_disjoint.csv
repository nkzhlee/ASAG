R_3Ny8iBQloIk5Ha2_q3_b,You can look at the previous orders that have been made in bulk and see which have had bad display screens and which have not. If you figure out that majority of the bulk orders have had complains about a bad display screen then you know to reject the order. Although if there is about half the orders that have had complaints then you should do more research on the computers. You may need to do multiple tests on the computers to see what the odds of the computers having a bad display screen.,q3_b,0.0,,0.0,0.0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,2

R_3rUmCW2tg1QCFnk_q3_b,A random selection of screens should be tested. If there are more than 5% that are bad we can reject the order. It won't be always representative of the whole population but you cannot check each display.,q3_b,0.0,,0.0,1.0,3,2,1,2,0,0,0,2
