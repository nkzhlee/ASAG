R_vVR0LmpnPTIdilH_q3_b,"After looking at all the display screens, the results will allow us to draw conclusion on whether the products offered were good or bad.  / Each of the items will be analyzed and looked at in order to determine their quality. It might be also significant to ask to two trained engineer to look at one order. Indeed, this might help to avoid subjectivity on the quality of display screens. The more the results are objectives, the more they are reliable to generalize them later on.  / So each order will be analyzed by two different engineers. The results will be written down, and each order which has at least 5% of bad screens will be rejected. If the supplier provide once again new screen, the results might be compare to the first results obtained. If the results are bad the second time, the company could envisage to elimitate the supplier and not ask his services anymore.",q3_b,2.0,2.0,,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,2,0

R_UYAIIF6Gu2SIJhL_q3_b,You would take the data that the engineer gives you and would see if it was greater than 5%. If it is then you would want to send the order back so you aren't paying for monitors that aren't going to be used in laptops.,q3_b,2.0,,2.0,1.0,3,2,1,2,0,2,2,0
R_Oa1GILZ0zjG3P6p_q2_a,"Statistical Inference should only be used it there is a set number of how many notes you have to be able to recognize in order to have a ""good ear for music.""",q2_a,2.0,,1.0,2.0,3,2,1,2,0,2,2,1
R_54rp3Ziy4Qot1xX_q4_b,I want to know whether there is a difference in the size of the fish caught.  / H0 = no difference.  / Take from both a random sample of 20 fish. In that case the conditions are fulfilled.  / construct a confidence interval by finding the mean difference and the standard deviation of the differences.  /,q4_b,1.0,,2.0,2.0,3,2,1,2,0,2,2,1
R_3q9SH8FjGNHU4r2_q3_a,"No, since the engineer seems to be taking specific data from every one of the 'sample' screens in the population (assuming the population is the entire bulk order) it doesn't seem necessary to use statistical inference to determine whether the screens should be accepted or rejected in bulk. This scenario is more descriptive statistics.",q3_a,2.0,,1.0,2.0,3,2,1,2,0,2,2,1
R_33ds5XLB3ptgD0u_q2_a,Statistical inference should be used to compare Carla's listening skills compared to the other kids in her class. That way you would have a fine line as to which students have good ears and which don't due to whatever the mean amount of notes that are recalled by the students.,q2_a,1.0,,2.0,2.0,3,2,1,2,0,2,2,1
R_2f8Pg8FnM3c25x6_q2_b,"Test at least 30 students (10 random notes) / Find the mean and standard deviation of all students that take the test. / Than find the confidence interval for 95%.  / If Carla's mean is above the confidence interval than he has a ""good ear for music"".",q2_b,2.0,,1.0,2.0,3,2,1,2,0,2,2,1
R_yRcaK17vHAS3gNr_q4_a,"Yes, the mean data of the fish is collected and can be compared between the brothers.",q4_a,,2.0,2.0,,2,1,0,2,0,2,2,1
R_xl2qsdRZ4GDIRgZ_q4_b,"In order to determine whether Mark or Dan is a better Walleye fisherman using the data from the fishing trip, I would use a T-test in Statcrunch. First, I would label two columns, each with Mark and Dan's names. Then, I would put the means of the lengths of the fish each of the men, Mark and Dan, caught. Then, I would select ""Stat"" and ""T Stat,"" ""2 Sample,"" ""with data."" I would then compare the values found in order to determine who was a better fisherman. For example, if Mark's data had a higher p-value, he would be the better fisherman. Likewise, if Dan had a higher p-value, he wold be the better fisherman.",q4_b,,2.0,2.0,,2,1,0,2,0,2,2,1
R_xl2qsdRZ4GDIRgZ_q4_a,"Yes, statistical inference should be used to determine whether Mark or Dan is a better Walleye fisherman. Statistical inference should be used to determine this because we can find out who is a better Walleye fisherman using tests of the average length of the Walleyes. There are a plethora of tests available in Statcrunch, with which we can specifically test means involved in a scenario. For example, there are paired and unpaired tests which we can use to test the means of the lengths of the Walleyes caught by Mark and Dan.",q4_a,,2.0,2.0,,2,1,0,2,0,2,2,1
