R_324UbMKo5EPWTJ6_q2_a,Yes statistical inference should be used to predict how often Carla will guess correctly,q2_a,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,2,1
R_2vizuByAiaPctAn_q2_a,"Yes, I think it would show the percentage of people that have a good ear and what percentage do not.",q2_a,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,2,1
R_22Pq2yLMva5B2tB_q4_b,You would just find the z-scores for the two brothers.  The mean size fish for each and the standard deviation (or typical variation in size).  The z-score will standardize the data so it will be easy to compare.  No hypothesis test is necessary.,q4_b,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,2,1
R_1IT144gTqeDU5gk_q4_a,"Statistical inference could be used to determine whether Mark or Dan is a better Walleye fisherman because there is a specific measurement being taken to determine who is ""better"". Because they have a defined way to decide they can most defidently use statistical reference and can repeat this experiment as many times as they please in order to receive the most accurate data.",q4_a,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,2,1
R_1il0wcVOEolLudb_q2_a,Yes because they want to know what kind of notes she hearing,q2_a,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,2,1
R_3rSsapLCzLuUW08_q2_b,I would calculate the mean and standard deviation as to how often Carla is right when identifying the notes. Then conduct a confidence test and find the margin of error. It would need to be replicated several times to ensure its a normal distribution and that we have enough data to make reasonable assumptions.,q2_b,1.0,,1.0,2.0,3,2,1,2,0,1,2,1
R_2f6ST76DzsSNu3m_q2_a,"Yes, I believe statistical inference should be used to determine whether Carla has a ""good ear for music"". I believe this because we could test the probability of her ability to guess which note the teacher plays out of the seven notes.",q2_a,1.0,,2.0,1.0,3,2,1,2,0,1,2,1
R_22YwZfKEz4dkvsz_q3_b,"Plot the information into a graph and determine whether the amount of screens that do not work is less than 5%, if it Is then you know to return them to the distributor",q3_b,2.0,,1.0,1.0,3,2,1,2,0,1,2,0
R_1HeIWMAVfNldGx0_q2_b,"The only thing that comes to mind in how to properly use this method is to test her multiple times and determine her success rate which might be related to the confidence we are in her having a good ear. From there and using a certain amount of trials we might be able to come up with a confidence interval by calculating the margin of error using the number of trials as N and then creating a list possibly using each test and having each subsequent test of her ear having multiple notes used randomly (for example Test 1 could have two random notes, Test 2 could have 4, Test 3 could have 3, etc). From there we can determine how many she got correct of each note and include whatever percent (2/3 notes correct) in another list and calculate using either a Z or T test (depending on the amount of tests ""N"" to determine the confidence interval.",q2_b,1.0,,1.0,2.0,3,2,1,2,0,1,2,1
