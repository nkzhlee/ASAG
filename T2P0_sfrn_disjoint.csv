R_W8qdkKit0alV2mt_q3_b,If more than 5% of the screens tested by an engeneer are faulty then there is probabbly an issue with the production. if its outside the predicted statistical margin of error there is no telling by how much.,q3_b,2.0,,2.0,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,1,0
R_2XasEcUnU3o3pPd_q3_b,"If they test them and five percent of the TVs are faulty then they should reject them, especially above five percent. They are inferring the rest will be bad, which is probably true. They should accept them if they work mostly.",q3_b,2.0,,2.0,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,1,0
R_1exZMlpLwxi7Rfp_q4_b,"also, mark and dan should be comparing weight, not length.  / by creating tables of the weights of the fish from each brother,  means can be taken from each and the difference can be found. by testing the naul that the means of both brothers are homologus, we can either reject or FTR by finding the difference and from there the p value to determine the level of significance.",q4_b,2.0,,2.0,2.0,3,1,0,3,0,2,1,0
R_xl2qsdRZ4GDIRgZ_q3_b,"In order to decide whether the electronics company should accept or reject the order of display screens using the data gathered by the trained engineer, I would list all the data in a table inside Statcrunch. I would then use the Normal calculator to see if the number of screens that is bad is greater than a proportion of 0.05 of these 150 display screens. If the result of the Normal calculator shows that, indeed, the number of screens that is bad is greater than a proportion of 0.05 of these 150 display screens, we would know to reject the order. If not, however, we would be forced to accept the order instead.",q3_b,,2.0,2.0,,2,1,0,2,0,2,0,0
