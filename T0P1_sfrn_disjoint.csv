R_4HoW8YibuRh1TVL_q2_a,"Having a ""good ear for music,"" is a term used to describe someone who has good relative pitch and can play or sing a tune.

Someone who can identify individual notes played by an instrument is said to have ""perfect pitch.""  That person may or may not actually have a good ear for music, they can simply identify notes.  Having perfect pitch does not necessarily mean that a person has a good ear for music, although it is usually the case.  They are simply two different musical terms.
