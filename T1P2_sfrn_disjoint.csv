R_XjgpcIgxPLOlhBL_q3_b,"Use the data the trained engineer gathers to determine what percent of display screens are bad, then determine whether to reject or accept the bulk order.",q3_b,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,0,2
R_UYAIIF6Gu2SIJhL_q2_a,"Yes, because if she can correctly identify the notes during the test of not identification, it would be safe to assume that she has a good ear for music and could correctly identify notes in the future.",q2_a,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,1,2
R_3suHzxtuLtxpssL_q3_a,No it is worth going through by hand to see each screen because it is tough to put a number on random screens coming in.,q3_a,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,1,2
R_3s7z2L1LPSAentK_q2_a,You could calculate the chances of Carla getting the correct answer by chance.,q2_a,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,1,2
R_3Ny8iBQloIk5Ha2_q4_a,I think you should use statistical inference to determine who is the better Walleye fisherman. You can find the proportion of who would catch the bigger fish.,q4_a,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,1,2
R_3n60GTp9i2FtmH8_q2_a,"Yes, you could test several students to see what students could tell what notes were played, and which students could not.",q2_a,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,1,2
R_3KZMO16R6JknU0E_q3_b,You would want to test the 150 screens and show that more than 5 % of them would be bad. You would want to find the standard deviation and then the z-score and then find what % would actually be bad. If this is more than 5% then they would be able to reject there order.,q3_b,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,0,2
R_3Jr8e0DIeLtMX2A_q3_b,"I would see how many of the screens were determined to be good and bad and if set an amount that would be the limit before rejecting the order. Say the limit is set for 30% of the 150 screens can be bad before the order is rejected, if the number is over that limit then the order will be rejected. This will be determined by using the numbers of bad and good screens.",q3_b,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,1,2
R_2YbapoGMkqpTrMY_q4_a,"Yes, you can measure the correlation between the location and the amount of larger fish that they caught.",q4_a,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,1,2
R_2RXutsynoYrAHJ0_q2_a,"Yes, statistical inference should be used to determine whether Carla has a ""good ear for music."" Because having a ""good ear for music"" is defined, and not an opinionated question in this context, there are testable strategies to reach results. In this scenario, they also list how the test will be conducted.",q2_a,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,1,2
R_2rBChiNigJQtsZY_q2_a,Statistical inference can be used to determine whether Carla has a good ear because the data could be use to determine if she got the notes right.,q2_a,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,1,2
R_1NlgiAIqCAd9XE6_q2_a,Statistical inference could be used in this situation because we are testing if Carla has a good ear for music based upon numbers.,q2_a,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,1,2
R_1k1cz6EEJ6qXXpd_q3_b,have a set percentage of screens that are useable for you to accept if the percentage of damaged screens are to high dont accept the screens.,q3_b,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,1,0,3,0,1,1,2
R_3R2hJ2cPFTQnfrc_q4_a,Yes because the the amount of fish and the size of the fish are variables that can be compared to determine the best fisherman,q4_a,1.0,,1.0,2.0,3,2,1,2,0,1,1,2
R_3q9SH8FjGNHU4r2_q4_a,Yes. Since the walleyes would be representative of the fish sizes they'd catch otherwise statistical inference allows us to figure out which is the better fisherman,q4_a,1.0,,1.0,2.0,3,2,1,2,0,1,1,2
R_3dYurRTniIE1iIx_q2_a,"yes, because if she can name the notes the chances she is able to guess the correct note is 1 to 7",q2_a,1.0,,2.0,1.0,3,2,1,2,0,1,1,2
R_2wBSrzMDz86nZtv_q3_b,"First what we need to do is obtain the number of screens that were considered bad. We then find the null and alternative hypothesis. The null would be H0: p = .005 an the alternative hypothesis would be HA: p >.005. Then we have to check if it passes the assumptions of whether the data was a random sample, whether the data was 10% less than the entire population and the success or failure condition (np > 10; and n(1-p)). We then state whether it will be distributed normally. Find the mean (which is the same as the null) and the standard deviation (sqrt of(( P0 (1-p0)/n)). Find the z statistic which is p-hat - p0 divided by the standard deviation. Find the p value from the z table an subtract than from one. If the value is smaller than alpha than reject the H0 and if it is bigger than alpha do not reject the H0. Create a conclusion see whether the 150 screens are bad.",q3_b,1.0,,0.0,1.0,3,2,1,2,0,1,0,2
R_2dJQZcGJNCDdWP1_q2_a,"Statistical inference could be used to determine Carla's ""good ear for music."" If you're only determining a person's ""good ear for music"" by their note recognition, then yes you could use statistical inference. Although in the real world, a ""good ear for music"" should be determined by more than just one factor.",q2_a,1.0,,0.0,1.0,3,2,1,2,0,1,1,2
R_2CjsCZiomZQ4mfj_q4_a,"Yes, they can compare the size of walleye caught for each person. /",q4_a,1.0,,1.0,2.0,3,2,1,2,0,1,1,2
R_XgZxV2ZPiDKWCLn_q4_b,"1.  I would plot Mark's data on a histogram, and then plot Dan's data on another.  I would compare these 2 histograms to determine the shape and whether or not there are any outliers. /  / 2.  I would then locate the Maximum, Minimum, Median, 1st Quartile, and 23rd Quartile.  I would plot these points in the beginnings of a boxplot.  To determine how far the whiskers go I would add or subtract 1.5IQR from the Quartiles. /      Minimum<Q1-1.5IQR=> The whisker goes out to Q1-1.5IQR, with lower points denoted by dots. /      Minimum>Q1-1.5IQR=> The whisker goes out to the Minimum. /      Maximum<Q3+1.5IQR=> The whisker goes out to Q3+1.5IQR, with higher points denoted by dots. /      Maximum>Q3+1.5IQR=> The whisker goes out to the Maximum. /  / 3.  I would finally compare the 2 boxplots to each other, drawing a line in at the overall mean, which I found by calculating the average length of all the fish caught.  The boxplot that is higher than the overall mean, and has a smaller IQR and whiskers will be the better fisherman of the 2, because they catch larger fish, with a smaller variability in the lengths of fish they catch.",q4_b,,,1.0,1.0,2,1,0,2,0,1,1,2
